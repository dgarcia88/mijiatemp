# MijiaTemp string resources for translation

If you would like to translate to the [MijiaTemp app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smrtprjcts.mijiabt) to your language you can choose from the below methods:

## POEditor method
POEditor has 1000 strings limit. [Join to translate project](https://poeditor.com/join/project/aBfzBj2DX6)

## Git method

Clone this repository or download the necessary XMLs (eg. the default English) and translate them (from values directory). 
Steps: 
* Create directory (values-\<lang\>) for the translated language eg. values-hu for Hungarian, values-de for German, etc. The correct language codes are in ISO639-1 colum at this [link](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).
* Copy the available values directory content to your directory. Translate the texts between > and < chars. Please pay attention to the special characters ( > < \n \" %s %.f etc) because non-proper strings can cause crashes.  

P.S: English strings are always up-to-date, that would be the better choice for translation. 

Thanks
